# K4D - Kubernetes for Developers - short version

This archive has labs for a Terra10 internal training for Kubernetes. Its goal is to give application developers a first glimpse of Kubernetes. 

A good next step is to continue with the labs that can be found in the [k4d github repo](https://github.com/lgorissen/k4d.git). 

The material in this training is highly inspired by the book [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) by Marko Luksa. If you need further studying material ... **BUY THAT BOOK**.

The labs in this archive cover the following topics:
